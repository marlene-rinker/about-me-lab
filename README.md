 - a 6th question that has the visitor guess a random number between 1 and 20
 - a 7th question where the visitor has to guess the name of one of my dogs
 - telling the visitor how many questions they answered "correctly" - which means like me

This update includes:
 - putting questions into functions (Devin was the Driver and Marlene was the Navigator)

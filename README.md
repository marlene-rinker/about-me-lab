### Versions

#### V 1.0 release date 4.1.2020
This site provides some information about me. This includes:
- a short bio
- my education
- my job experience
- my goals

It also prompts the visitor with a series of 5 questions so we can see what we have in common.


#### V 1.1 release date 4.2.2020
This update includes:
 - a new Top 10 section at the bottom of the page
 - a 6th question that has the visitor guess a random number between 1 and 20
 - a 7th question where the visitor has to guess the name of one of my dogs
 - telling the visitor how many questions they answered "correctly" - which means like me
